# SpidyTower
## A simple infinite-runner game inspired by IcyTower

You play as Spider-man to try to save people from buildings attacked by the Green Golbin, while trying to survive yourself.

The game is unfinished (lacks sound, some of the planned mechanics) and has a deadlock bug in the movement mechanics.
